        <h1 class="2013">2013 ICC Champions Trophy Campaign </h1>
        Ever since 2013, team India has struggled in knockout matches of ICC events. They have started tournments as favourites everytime but have always fallen short of the finish line. As they say "So close yet so far" has been the story for the Indian team. India first lost the 2014 ICC T20 WC final to Sri Lanka but who would've thought it was just going to be the start of misery coming their way throughout the next decade.<br />

        <h1>ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 Campaign </h1>
        After successfully winning the Asia Cup in 2018, Indian team found their next challenge in the 2019 Cricket World Cup. It was also a special one for them as it was going to be the last tournment played by legendary MS Dhoni. Rohit Sharma found the form of his life in the tournment hitting 5 centuries. India topped the ten team group stage and faced New Zealand in the semi finals. After a thrilling encounter, MS Dhoni was runout and India fell just 18 runs short of 240 run target given by the Kiwis. It really was a sad ending as MS Dhoni never got the farewell he deserved and India's ICC trophy drought extended to over 6 years by this time.

        <h1>WTC Final 2021 and ICC T20 World Cup 2021 losses </h1>
        2021 was a thrilling year for the India as they were almost certain they will be brining an ICC trophy back home as there were two ICC tournments going to be held that year, the ICC T20 WC in the UAE and the finals of WTC in which India qualified by playing superbly in the group stage. India first lost the WTC final to New Zealand but were certain they will put up a dominant performance in T20 WC. Alas! The opposite happened, they had a group stage exit ater losing their first two matches to Pakistan and New Zealand. The Indian skipper Virat Kohli was soon terminated from the leadership role as he lost 4 ICC tournments as captain and dissapointed the selectors, the coach Ravi Shastri was also removed.

        <h1>ICC T20 World Cup 2022 Campaign </h1>
        Soon after the end of Kohli-Shastri era, India appointed Rohit Sharma and Rahul Dravid as their new captain and coach. India's next assignment was going to be the T20 WC 2022 held in Australia and they prepared themselves well for one whole year, BCCI arranged them a lot of T20I matches. Under the new regime of Rohit and Dravid, India adopted an aggressive strategy to attack in the first six overs of the powerplay. This strategy worked on and off but because of this India found a star batsmen in the form of Suryakumar Yadav who started doing wonders for them at number 4 position. He smashed a ton of runs, his highlight innings was 117 against England. Kohli also started finding his rhythem. <br />India with KL Rahul and Rohit Sharma as openers, Kohli coming in at 3 followed Surya at 4 seemed like a formidable unit. Rohit ensured all the players that they shall be backed and asked them to play fearless cricket. India won a lot of blirateral series home and away and stepped in T20 WC 2022 well prepared. India topped the WC group stage by winning their matches against Pakistan, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh and Netherlands. They got matched with England in the semi's. After a batting collapse and a bit of recovery India gave England an under par target which England chased easily with overs to spare courtesy of the dynamic duo of the openers ALex Hales and Jos Buttler. India lost the match by 10 wickets. A whole year's effort and preparation went in vein, yet another heartbreak for the Indians and the wait to win another ICC trophy continued.

        <h1>ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 Campaign</h1>
       India continued playing their fearless brand of cricket in limited over formats. They had a home Cricket World Cup coming at the end of 2023 and what better opportunity they could've had to finish their decade long ICC trophy drought. Right before the start of World Cup, India managed to win Asia Cup 2023, securing their 8th Asia Cup title, they also won the ODI series against Australia right after the ASia Cup victory. <br />
       Something that the cricketing world had never seen, India who sticked to playing their fearless brand of cricket put up a dominant display in the WC hammering opposition and winning in dominating fashion. Rohit, Virat, KL and Iyer smashed hundreds for fun. India won all 9 of their group stage matches and met New Zealand in the semi's, the same team that showed them the exist door in 2019. India batted first and posted a target of 398 for the Kiwis to chase. The Kiwis fought hard but the target of almost 400 proved to be a bit too much for them and India eventually won the game by a margin of 70 runs. India took their revenge of the loss handed to them back in 2019.
       <br />
       The grand final was scheduled to be played at Narendra Modi Cricket stadium in Ahmedabad and India found Australia as their opposition. India came in the final undefeated. They had the perfect team they could build that had all bases covered. The batting was firing, the bowling was unplayable. On the match day the statidum was filled with 130,000 Indians cheering for the home team. It felt like the perfect fairytale - taking revenge from Australia for WTC final loss earlier in the year and finally finishing their trophy drought. Aussies won the toss and asked India to bat first. After a quickfire start India had a batting collapse, KL Rahul and Virat Kohli tried to steady the ship. Rahul got out on 66 off 107 and Kohli was dismissed on 54 by a beauty by Cummins. India never recovered from then on and gave Australia an under par taregt of 241. Australia lost a few early wickets while chasing but Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne ensured Australia crossed the finish line. Head was the agressor while Marnus anchored the innings. Aussies comfortably won the match by 6 wickets maintaining their dominance in ICC tournments and winning their 6th  Cricket World Cup title.
